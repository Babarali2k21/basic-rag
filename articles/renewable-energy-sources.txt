Renewable energy comes from resources that naturally replenish, such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal. 
Unlike fossil fuels, renewables are more sustainable and eco-friendly. 
Solar power uses photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity, while wind turbines harness wind energy. 
Countries worldwide are investing heavily in renewable energy to reduce carbon emissions.
